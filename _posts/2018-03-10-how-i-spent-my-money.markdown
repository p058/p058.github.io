As I was going through my emails, I see my credit card statements with big $$ at
at end. I wanted to analyze what I was spending my money on and also because I had
nothing else to do, I exported my credit card statements for the last ~18 months and
did some analysis

I spent most of my money on Merchandise & Restaurants.

When I grilled down further, I spent most of my money in the Merchandise category on Amazon, so
I exported my amazon order history and interestingly I spent most on Health, Grocery. Combined with
my non-amazon spending, majority of my money goes into food, which makes sense, because I hardly cook. : P
