As I was going through my emails, I see my credit card statements with big $$ at
at end. I wanted to analyze what I was spending my money on and also because I had
nothing else to do, I exported my credit card statements for the last ~18 months and
did some analysis

I spent most of my money on Merchandise & Restaurants.

When I grilled down further, I spent most of my money in the Merchandise category on Amazon, so
I exported my amazon order history and interestingly I spent most on Health, Grocery. Combined with
my non-amazon spending, majority of my money goes into food, which makes sense, because I hardly cook. : P

Money spent on amazon over time. The number of orders I made on amazon averaged at ~ 15 orders per month
for Jun'17-Jan'18. That's a lot of spending. : (

Within food, I spent a lot of money on delivery after I moved to Austin. When I was in Kansas, I used
to go out to eat or get food, but after moving to Austin, I relied mostly on Doordash/Grubhub (No doordash in Kansas).
In Aug, Sep, I ordered from Doordash/Grubhub on a daily basis. In Oct, I got a roommate, who is a pretty good cook :P,
so naturally the number of orders went down a bit. In January, I made a new year resolution to cut down on
my delivery spending & instead go out & get good. I did good for one month there....

Finally, while plotting my spending habits, I realized how I never get bored of eating the same food.
The plot below shows how I ate at the same restaurants continuously for several weeks and then moved on to a
different restaurant.
